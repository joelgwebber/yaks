# Yaks — Task tracking workflow

This project tracks work with yaks: each task (a **yak**) is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter in a `.yaks/` **farm** that lives on its own git branch. Follow this workflow so task state stays accurate.

## Running yaks

A plain CLI, run from the shell (no slash commands, nothing to keep running): `yaks <cmd>` if it is on `PATH`, else `npx @j15r/yaks <cmd>`, else `./target/release/yaks <cmd>` in a checkout you built. Add `--json` to any query command for machine-readable output; `yaks create --json` also prints the new id and path.

## Where the farm lives

The farm is an orphan branch (`yaks`) holding only `.yaks/`, checked out once per machine under `~/.local/share/yaks/farms/`. Every checkout of the repo (yours, the human's, each agent clone) reads and writes that one farm, so yak edits are live everywhere.

```sh
yaks path                  # which farm am I on?
yaks status                # what is uncommitted; is the branch ahead/behind?
yaks commit                # commit the farm on its branch (from any cwd)
yaks sync                  # commit, pull (yak-aware merge), push
```

- **Never stage `.yaks/` with your code.** Code commits never contain yaks.
- **Sync at session start, after landing work, and before switching machines.** Nothing syncs on its own, and nothing you write reaches another machine until you sync. On a machine nobody is sitting at (a cloud runner, a VM, a remote box: no human there reads this farm directly), also **sync after every note or state move** you make: that is the only way anyone else sees your progress, and a reset there deletes the farm worktree with every unsynced write. If a yakherd coordinates you, it syncs and you don't, unless your brief says otherwise. In `yaks tui`, `W` commits and `U` syncs.
- **Starting one:** `yaks init` (the branch, its worktree and these skills; idempotent). A clone of a repo with `origin/yaks` needs no setup.
- **Sharing another repo's farm:** `yaks init --farm <checkout> --herd <h>` sets `git config yaks.farm`/`yaks.herd`; this repo then uses that farm, and `yaks create` puts new yaks in herd `<h>`.
- **`YAKS_DIR=<dir>`** overrides discovery for one command.

**Private farms.** `yaks private` keeps the farm on this machine: a `pre-push` hook refuses any push of the farm branch, and `yaks sync` never pushes. `git config yaks.private` says whether it is set.

## Vocabulary

- **States** (adjectives): **hairy** (not started), **shaving** (in progress), **shorn** (done), and the hidden **dead**.
- **Verbs** (the commands): **shave** (hairy → shaving), **shear** / `yaks shorn` (shaving → shorn), **regrow** (shorn → hairy), **slaughter** (→ dead), **revive** (dead → hairy).
- **Farm**: one `.yaks/` store, on its own branch. **Herd**: the yaks sharing one id prefix (a farm can hold several; `yaks create --herd <h>`). **Family**: a parent yak and its descendants. **Shed**: someone working in the farm (a human, a worker, a thread), known by the actor name on their notes; `yaks sheds` lists them, on any machine once the farm is synced.

## Hard rules

1. **Never write code without a shaving yak.** Even a one-line fix: `yaks shave <id>` first (create the yak if needed). A claim is how everyone else, on any machine, sees what you are working on; unclaimed work is invisible.
2. **Shear as soon as the work is done:** evidence and a summary note, then `yaks shorn <id>`.
3. **Keep yak ids out of external surfaces:** PR titles and bodies and external trackers. Ids are fine in commit messages, unless the farm is private (`yaks private`): then keep ids, and the word "yaks", out of commits, code and comments, since their readers cannot see the farm. Use the external key instead (`yaks rollup --keys`; the **yaks-tracker** skill). `yaks scan-ids [FILE]` exits non-zero if text holds a real yak id; wire it into a hook.

## Workflow

1. **Session start:** name yourself: `export YAKS_ACTOR=<short stable name>` if you are an agent (else your notes carry a harness name that can change mid-session, or the human's git name). Then `yaks sync` (unless a yakherd coordinates); then `yaks inbox --for agent` (answers and requests nobody has acted on: handle these first); then `yaks next`.
2. **Before code:** `yaks shave <id>`, and its parent if still hairy. Re-read it with `yaks show <id>`; the latest note is the freshest signal.
3. **While working:** `yaks update <id> --note "..."`, one event per note, at each milestone and at least every 30 minutes of work: your latest note is how others tell a busy worker from a dead one.
4. **Code others can't see** (you are on another machine, or in a clone nobody reads): at each checkpoint, commit, push your work branch to `origin` (any branch name, your harness's own pattern is fine, but never `main` and never under `yaks/`: the farm branch `yaks` blocks that prefix, so such a branch cannot be pushed), note it (`--meta kind=checkpoint --meta branch=<branch> --meta commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`), then sync. In that order, so the farm never names a commit nobody can fetch.
5. **Stopping without finishing:** to resume later, a note saying where you stopped and what's next (the claim stays yours and reads `stale` in `yaks sheds` after 2 hours); to give it up, that note and then `yaks regrow <id>`, so nobody mistakes it for live work.
6. **Done:** gather evidence, add a short summary note (see "Evidence before you shear"), `yaks shorn <id>`. Shear the parent when its last child is shorn; never leave a hairy parent over shorn children.

**You share the farm with a human.** They edit yaks in `yaks tui` while you work, so a yak may move, gain a note or appear without you. That is signal, not an error: don't revert, restage or report it; follow it if it redirects your work.

## The inbox: work waiting on someone

A yak's `needs` field says who acts next, and `yaks inbox` lists every yak that has one: **awaiting a human** (`needs: human`) or **awaiting an agent** (`needs: agent`, marked `answered` or `requested`).

**Asking a human.** For a decision only a human should make (an ambiguous requirement, a risky tradeoff, a missing credential), don't guess:

- `yaks ask <id> --note "the question"` sets `needs: human` and drops the yak out of `yaks next`. Then return control.
- The human runs `yaks answer <id> --note "..."` (or `a` in the TUI), which sets `needs: agent`. Never answer your own ask.
- `yaks inbox` marks a yak `replied` when the human answered with a plain note instead of `answer`.
- Also ask to *record* a real design fork (behavior a user sees, a data format, a dependency) even when you have a lean: state the lean in the question.
- **Design questions belong on yaks, not only in chat.** When a design pass raises questions for the human, ask each on the yak it concerns, with the options and your lean, and in chat link the asks rather than restating them. The question and its answer then stay with the yak for whoever picks it up later; record the outcome as a `Decision:` note when you pick it up. A yak holds one open ask at a time: put related questions in one numbered ask, or split the yak first.

**Requests.** A human (or a yakherd) hands you work with `yaks request <id> --note "..."` (`a` in the TUI on a yak that isn't awaiting them): a chore on that yak, such as tidying its markdown, summarizing its notes or checking something. Treat it as an instruction from the human, scoped to that yak, and do it now unless it needs a decision (then `ask`). A canned one (`--kind tidy|summarize`) arrives as a `Tidy request:` / `Summarize request:` note carrying its whole instruction: follow it literally. It ends with `yaks pickup <id> --drop-request`, which removes the request note so the yak shows only the result; use that for any request whose result speaks for itself.

**Taking it on.** For either kind, `yaks pickup <id> --note "what I'll do"` is the only thing that clears `needs: agent`; then do the work and note the result. An inbox row you leave stays there for the next agent.

**Waiting.** `yaks wait --for agent --timeout 10m` blocks until something is awaiting an agent, then prints it like `inbox` (exit 0; exit 2 on timeout). If your harness can run a command in the background, run it there after an `ask` to be woken by the answer; otherwise return and check `yaks inbox` next session. `--new` ignores rows already there when it started.

## Notes and descriptions

Bodies are GitHub-flavoured CommonMark. The TUI renders each note as its own document, and a human reads it there, so write for a reader scanning a pane, not a log file.

**Shape.**

- **A blank line between every block.** A single newline is only a space: lines with no blank line between them join into one paragraph. Separate each paragraph, list, heading, code fence and table from its neighbours by a blank line. Don't hard-wrap prose.
- **Short blocks.** A paragraph makes one point in a few sentences. Parallel facts (results, files, per-case numbers, next steps) are a list, one item each. A long body with distinct parts gets `##` headings.
- Fence commands, code and pasted output, with a language (```` ```sh ````). Put ids, paths, flags and symbols in backticks.
- Also rendered: tables, task lists (`- [ ]`), footnotes, strikethrough and alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`). Not rendered: inline HTML (shows as literal text), math, emoji shortcodes; mermaid shows as a code block.
- Keep a `Decision:` note (the choice and the alternatives rejected) separate from progress notes.

**Metadata.** A note can carry `key: value` fields, which the TUI shows in its header and `yaks show --json` lists under `meta`. The commands stamp their own (`kind: move`, `ask`, `answer`, `request`, `pickup`, `verify`; `yaks land` writes `kind: landed`); add yours with `--meta key=value` on `yaks update`, which needs a note: `yaks update <id> --note "..." --meta kind=checkpoint --meta branch=<branch> --meta commit=<sha>`. Reserved keys: `kind`, `for`, `commit`, `branch`, `remote`, `thread`. In the file they sit under the note's `▸` line, closed by `---`, like a yak's frontmatter; never write that by hand.

Not this (one run-on paragraph, because single newlines join):

```text
G1 landed (d84aa65). Splits families into tokens; fullstory joins 161.
NO FIXTURE yet: the hand-built one didn't reproduce the chain.
Next: G3's question, so it belongs with yak-7af5.
```

This:

```markdown
G1 landed (d84aa65): families are now split into their tokens.

- fullstory: 161 joins
- no fixture yet: the hand-built one didn't reproduce the chain

Next: G3's question, which belongs with yak-7af5.
```

**Links.**

- Another yak: its **full id** (`yak-0af1`, never the bare `0af1`); the TUI makes it a link and `yaks refs <id> [--incoming]` lists the references.
- Repo code, in a yak: a path from the repo root behind one `../`, with GitHub's line fragment: `[fn parse](../src/foo.rs#L12-L40)`; `../blob/<sha>/src/foo.rs#L12` pins it to a commit.
- Attachments: `yaks attach` writes the link (`[name](<id>/<file>)`, `![name](...)` for an image). Attach images and long output rather than pasting them.
- Size an image with a trailing alt-text token: `![shot =50%](<id>/shot.png)`, `=300x200` or `=x120` (px, or `%` of width).
- **A yak from your conversation with the human:** when your harness renders links to local files (Zed, Delta, most IDE chats), link the yak's file by its absolute path, as printed by `yaks path yak-0af1` (`[yak-0af1](/home/me/.local/share/yaks/farms/.../yak-0af1.md)`), so they can open it in one click. A yak's file never moves, so the link stays good. (Hard rule 3 still keeps ids out of PRs and trackers.)

**Writing it.** Any note with a newline, a backtick or a `$` goes on stdin: `yaks update <id> --note - <<'EOF'` … `EOF` (quoted `'EOF'` keeps backticks and `$` literal). Never inside `$( )` or a double-quoted argument, where backticks run as commands. `--note-file` / `--description-file` read a file; the same `-` works for `create --description`, `ask --note` and `answer --note`.

## Evidence before you shear

Shear against evidence, not vibes: "it compiles" or a self-report is not enough.

- **A command proves it:** store it with `yaks update <id> --verify '<cmd>'` and run `yaks verify <id>`, which records PASS/FAIL as a note anyone can re-run. `yaks doctor --strict` flags a shorn yak whose `verify:` did not last pass.
- **A web UI change:** a screenshot of the changed state, attached. `sightmap browser`, when available, can find the component and capture just it.
- **A TUI change:** a text frame of the changed state at least; a rendered screenshot if the TUI library can produce one.
- **Code:** link the code that matters (`[fn parse](../src/foo.rs#L12-L40)`); a short snippet only when it is the point.
- **Logs and long output:** the few lines that show the result, fenced; attach the rest.
- Update every surface that describes a user-facing change (in-app help, `--help`, docs) in the same change.
- **No way to verify it?** `yaks ask` whether to build one rather than shearing on faith.

Skip what makes no sense for the change; never skip it because it is effort.

**The summary note** is short: what changed and, unless that already says it all (a typo fix), the shape of the fix in a sentence or two; the evidence (linked or attached, per the list above), and any yaks spawned. Not a bare "done", and not a design doc: a long write-up goes in an attachment the note links to.

`yaks attach` stores the file beside the yak in `.yaks/<herd>/yaks/<id>/` and links it in the body.

## Labels

Few and broad (`ui`, `docs`, `cli`): reuse an existing label before inventing one (`yaks stats` lists them), at most two or three per yak, one word each (`--labels ui,docs` is two labels). A tracker label (`jira`, `github`) marks yaks that map to an external issue.

## Commands

Every command has `--help`; this is the map. Global flags: `-C <path>` (run as if in `<path>`, like `git -C`), `--as <actor>` on any write (else `$YAKS_ACTOR`, else a Delta thread name, else the git user).

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create "title"` | New hairy yak: `--type --priority --parent --herd --labels --depends-on --source --pr --verify --description` |
| `list` / `next` / `tangled` / `search` | Query (shared filters, below); `next` = hairy with deps met, `tangled` = blocked on deps |
| `show <id>` | Full details, parent and children |
| `path [<id>...]` | Absolute file path of yaks (by id or filters); no arguments: the farm in use |
| `update <id>...` | Fields, `--add-label`/`--remove-label`, `--note` (with `--meta key=value`), `--verify`, `--source`, `--pr`/`--remove-pr` |
| `shave` / `shorn` / `regrow` / `slaughter` / `revive` | State moves; several ids at once; each appends an attributed `moved:` entry. `slaughter --family` takes descendants too |
| `ask` / `answer` / `request` / `pickup` / `inbox` / `wait` | The inbox (above); `inbox --for human\|agent`, `wait --timeout 10m` |
| `verify <id>` | Run the yak's `verify:` (else the config default) and record PASS/FAIL |
| `attach <id> <file>` | Store and link evidence; `rename-attachment` renames one |
| `log` | Notes and moves over a filtered set, oldest first; `--since 2h`, `--by <actor>` |
| `refs <id>` | What it points at; `--incoming` for what points at it |
| `commits <id>` | Commits recorded on the yak (`yaks land` writes them) and the branches its checkpoints name (`--fetch` fetches them), then those naming it in the code repo you run it from, then the yak file's farm history |
| `dep` / `reparent` | Add/remove a dependency; move under `--parent <id>` or `--unparent` |
| `bulk` | One field edit or reparent over a filtered set; dry-run unless `--commit`; refuses without a filter |
| `rename` / `rename-herd` | Rename a yak or a whole herd, rewriting every reference; `--dry-run` first |
| `status` / `commit` / `sync` | The farm's uncommitted changes; commit them; commit, pull and push it |
| `private [--off]` | Keep the farm on this machine |
| `init` / `migrate` / `merge` | Start a farm (or `--farm` to share one); upgrade an old schema; consolidate another farm |
| `doctor [--strict]` / `preflight` | Farm integrity; pre-landing check |
| `stats` / `rollup [--keys]` | Counts; yaks grouped by external issue |
| `skills install` / `skills status` | Install or check these skills |
| `tui` | The interactive UI (`?` lists its keys) |

Coordinating several agents (`brief`, `land`, `sheds`) is the **yaks-coordinating** skill.

## Filtering

`list`, `next`, `tangled`, `search`, `path`, `log` and `bulk` share filters: `--status`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--label`, `--herd` (each repeatable, OR within a flag), `--search Q`, `--ready`, `--tangled`, `--needs`, `--run-on` (a body whose lines join into one paragraph), `--parent-of <id>` (its descendants); AND across flags. `--all` includes dead yaks.

```sh
yaks list --type bug --priority 1
yaks next --label auth
yaks bulk --parent-of yak-c3d4 --add-label spike --commit
```

**Large farms.** Don't summarize yak files through `ls .yaks/... | xargs`: past a few thousand paths `xargs` splits the list and a total like `xargs wc -l | tail -1` is silently wrong, and an absolute glob fails with "argument list too long". List with `yaks list --json` or `yaks path <filters>` (one path per line); to total, feed one stream to one counter (`yaks path --status shorn | xargs cat | wc -l`, never `xargs wc` or `find -exec wc {} +`, which print a total per batch).

## Task format

Each yak is one file, `.yaks/<herd>/yaks/<id>.md`, at the same path for life (a state move edits `status:` in place):

```markdown
---
id: yak-a1b2              # flat {prefix}-{4hex}; never encodes hierarchy
title: Fix the login crash
status: shaving           # hairy | shaving | shorn | dead
type: bug
priority: 2
created: "2026-02-16T10:00:00Z"
updated: "2026-02-16T10:30:00Z"
parent: yak-c3d4          # optional; the only source of hierarchy
depends_on: [yak-e5f6]
labels: [auth]
source: https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJ-123   # optional external issue
prs:                      # optional: the yak's open pull requests
- https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
---

Details go here.
```

Don't parse ids for hierarchy (old dotted ids like `yak-a1b2.1` are opaque). `.yaks/config.yaml` sets the default `herd`, `default_type`, `default_priority` and a `verify:` map (label → command, plus `default`); a `herds:` map overrides those per herd, one level deep. A farm on an older schema is refused by every command but `yaks migrate`.
