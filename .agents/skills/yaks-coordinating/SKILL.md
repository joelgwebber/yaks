# Coordinating yaks

You are the **yakherd**: the one agent that claims yaks, briefs workers, lands their work and talks to the human. A **worker** owns exactly one yak and follows `yaks-working`. One agent with no helpers needs only `yaks-working`.

**The design test.** If something is a query or mutation over the task files, it belongs in the yaks tool; if it assumes subagents, worktrees or an orchestration, it belongs here. With one agent yaks is memory and a log; with many it is a shared blackboard.

## 1. The farm everyone shares

`yaks path` (no arguments) prints the farm. In the recommended setup it is a **branch farm**: one worktree per machine that every checkout (yours, the human's, each worker's) reads and writes live. So:

- Claims, notes, shears and asks are visible to everyone the moment they are written. There is no yak state to merge and nothing under `.yaks/` in any code commit.
- **You commit the farm** (`yaks commit`), at least at every landing. **You sync it** (`yaks sync`) at session start, after landings and before a machine switch. Until the human has published the farm (`yaks status` shows no upstream), use `yaks sync --no-push`: the first push creates the remote branch.
- Yak ids are fine in commit messages once the farm is published; on a `yaks private` farm treat it as private (below).

**A private farm** (`yaks private`, `.yaks/` excluded, or a `.yaks` pointer file) is also live and shared. An excluded or pointer farm is not found from a worker's checkout (its own git top-level): every worker command needs `YAKS_DIR=<abs farm path>` (`yaks brief` adds it). Keep yak ids out of commits, code, comments and PRs (`yaks scan-ids` checks text), and after landing note the landed SHA on the yak, since git cannot link it.

## 2. The shape: claim, fan out, land, reconcile

1. **Claim.** Create or pick the leaf yaks, `yaks shave` each, and write a claim note: owner name, scope by file and symbol, out of scope, evidence contract, judge (section 4).
2. **Fan out.** One worker per yak, each from your freshest state, each with a brief (section 5).
3. **Land.** Only you land, one worker at a time, by the SHA in its final message, then check it (section 6).
4. **Reconcile.** A yak still `shaving` after the batch is stalled: `regrow` it or re-run it. `yaks doctor`, `yaks commit`.

**Watching workers.** `yaks log --by <worker> --since 1h` and `yaks inbox` show their notes and asks live. `yaks sheds` lists every checkout with its git facts (branch, ahead/behind, dirty files, merged) and the yaks it wrote, newest first, with when it last wrote: that tells a slow worker from a dead one.

## 3. Scope work so it cannot collide

- **One writer per yak.** Never edit a yak a worker owns while it runs; summarize onto the parent yourself afterwards. Shared work gets split into child yaks first.
- **Types, not only files.** A change to a shared type (a struct built in many places) breaks the other workers at merge: land it first as your own prep commit. Scan with `grep 'TypeName {'`.
- **One big file?** Give each worker a disjoint function or region, anchor by symbol (`fn name`), never by line number, and warn that a shared render path can ripple into snapshots.

## 4. Evidence contract and judge

The claim note says what counts as done and who decides, and the judge shears: a script (the yak's `verify:` or the config default; the worker shears on PASS and you re-run it), the human for a subjective call (`yaks ask`), or you at landing. If you cannot say what the evidence is, the lever is missing: ask the human about building one before you fan out.

## 5. The brief

`yaks brief <id> --as <name>` prints everything the yak, config and farm determine: the yak and that it is shaving, the `YAKS_ACTOR=<name>` prefix (and `YAKS_DIR`), the binary, the gate, forbidden moves, how to finish for this farm, how to ask and pick up, the `Decision:` rule and the final-message format. It warns if the yak is not claimed. Add only what a yak cannot know:

```
<output of `yaks brief <id> --as <name>`>
Task: <what and what not>. Scope by symbol: <files, functions>. Out of scope: everything else;
if you must touch another file, `yaks ask` instead.
Evidence beyond the gate: <the test that fails before and passes after>.
Do not read, write or build in any other checkout.
```

Pass `--yaks-dir <farm>` when the worker's checkout cannot find the farm. If the task changes yaks itself, tell the worker to build and use its own binary.

## 6. Landing

1. **Land by SHA:** `yaks land <sha> --dry-run`, then `yaks land <sha>`. It lands one single-parent squash commit (or a cherry-pick when the base moved), checks the result against `git merge-tree`, and never pushes. It refuses while your tree has changes the commit does not explain, a SHA whose change a merge dropped, and a commit that stages `.yaks/` beside a branch farm.
2. **Re-run the gate yourself** and reproduce the key scenario with your own build. A claim you cannot reproduce is rejected, not annotated: `git revert` the landing and regrow the yak.
3. **Read the diff** for quality and for every surface the change touches (docs, skills, README, `--help`, in-app help); make fixes as your own follow-up commits.
4. `yaks doctor`, then `yaks commit`. Never write a claim into a yak that you did not observe.

## 7. Asks

- A worker that needs a decision runs `yaks ask`, leaves its edits and returns.
- **Scope and mechanics** (reversible, local to the yak's goal: one more file, which test shape): answer it yourself with `yaks answer <id> --note "..."`, saying you are the yakherd, then wake the worker. The answer is the record; the message is only the wake-up.
- **A design fork** (behavior a user sees, a data format, a dependency, a shipped surface, anything a reviewer would want a say in; if unsure, it is a fork): leave the ask open, and tell the human the yak id and your lean (record the lean on the parent yak, never the worker's). Wake the worker once `yaks inbox` shows it answered.
- At session start and after each batch, run `yaks inbox`. A yak marked `replied` got a plain-note answer: record it with `yaks answer`, quoting the human and saying you read it from their note.

## 8. Attribution and drift

Every note and move carries an actor: `--as <name>` or `YAKS_ACTOR=<name>` on each command (else a Delta thread name, else the git user, which is the human). A move is not evidence; a shorn yak still needs a real note. The human edits yaks while you work: a yak that moved or gained a note is a person beside you, not an error; follow it if it changes your task.

## 9. In Delta

Your thread is the yakherd; each worker is a subthread with its own clone, which starts from a snapshot of your working tree.

- **Spawning.** Start each title with the worker's name (`sheds-1: build the sheds CLI`): Delta exports it, and yaks names the worker's notes and its row in `yaks sheds` after it. Record the worker's name, agent id, model and base commit on the umbrella yak or in your landing note, never on the worker's yak. Pass `model` only when the human asked for one.
- **What comes back is not trustworthy.** Delta merges a result against what it last applied to your tree, not your HEAD: expect a pending `MERGE_HEAD`, stray modified files, a worker's unfinished edits, even files reset to an old snapshot. Never `git add -A` after a worker returns and never hand-revert Delta's applied state; `yaks land <sha>` sorts it out. While any worker is running or parked, don't rewrite your branch (no `reset --hard`, no rebase): its old base turns the next landing into add/add conflicts.
- **Waking a worker.** `send_agent_message` to its thread id; it resumes with its context. Tell it to `yaks pickup <id>` when an answer is waiting.
- **A worker can die silently** (most often when the human moves the thread to another machine). Overdue with no new note and no growing dirty count in `yaks sheds`: presume it dead, have a replacement review its draft, and after two deaths finish the task yourself.
- **Landing in the human's checkout.** Thread commits reach the human's repo on no branch; `main` moves only by your `git push local <branch>:main`. First run `yaks preflight --push-main` (on a shared machine `local` can be a bare repo the human never looks at; it then names the fallback). Never push `origin` or open a PR without the human's say-so.
- **On another machine,** `local` is that machine's checkout and may be behind: `git fetch origin`, check `yaks preflight --push-main`, and fast-forward it with `git push local origin/main:main`. Then `yaks sync`.
- Project skills load only from real files in `.agents/skills/`; the `skill` tool needs the worktree argument. Still put the critical rules in the brief.

## 10. With git worktrees

- **Cut a shed** from your freshest commit: `git worktree add wt/<name> -b <branch>`, in a directory that is not gitignored (some harnesses' file tools refuse ignored paths). Stage explicit paths; never `git add .`. `git worktree remove` it afterwards.
- **File tools rooted at the main checkout:** always edit through the explicit worktree path (`wt/<name>/src/foo.rs`); a bare `src/foo.rs` silently edits the main tree. After edits, `git -C <main> status --short` must show no stray source changes.
- **Each shed builds and tests its own binary.**
- **Serial arc** (phases that edit the same files in order): keep one shed for the arc, land each phase to main as it completes, then `git merge main` back into the shed.
- **Recovery:** a lost session is not lost work. `git -C wt/<name> status` and `diff`, build that shed, then finish it yourself or discard and re-run.
