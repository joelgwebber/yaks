description: |-
  Add a command to move tasks between parents (or to/from top-level). On reparent:
  1. Collect all old→new ID mappings (target + descendants)
  2. Rename files, update id fields
  3. Single scan of all yaks to rewrite depends_on references

  Supports:
  - reparent TASK_ID --parent NEW_PARENT (move under a new parent, auto-assign child number)
  - reparent TASK_ID --unparent (promote to top-level, needs a new base ID)

  Descendant IDs update recursively (e.g. foo.3.1 → bar.N.1).
