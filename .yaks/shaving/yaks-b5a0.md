The coordination layer (the yaks-coordinating / yaks-working dev skills, public vs private farm modes, claim -> fan out -> merge) is nascent, hard to follow, and lightly tested. Goal: parallel agent work on a yaks farm that is reliable and legible in each environment we actually use: plain git worktrees today, Delta threads and subagents next. Test aggressively against real runs and refactor the skills and CLI freely as we learn.

Principles: prove it with real runs, not prose; one followable skill per environment instead of one skill full of conditionals; install/init make the right setup explicit rather than leaving agents to infer it.

Related, not reparented (decide whether to fold in): yaks-10fb (post-3901 follow-ups: 5d5c, 213b, eb5f, 70e5, 8265), yaks-5f12 (Model 3 vs git-store), yaks-c061 (answered-question pickup), yaks-0a87 (checkpoint footgun), yaks-75cc (drift as signal), yaks-77a5 (lightning-round case study).
